Note: the xampp folder contains already the installation (win 10, 64bit, maybe its ready to start, therefore start the xampp-control.exe)

3) Create password for database:
	3.1) open phpmyadmin: localhost/phpmyadmin
	3.2) under Users -> root (localhost) -> edit priviliges -> change password to root
		 Note: now you cannot access anymore localhost/phpmyadmin!
		 
		 -> go to Xampp Application and for Apache hit the config button -> file entry config.inc.php
			change entry: $cfg['Servers'][$i]['password'] = ''; with your password (roto)
		
		 -> go to Xampp Application and for Mysql hit the config button -> file entry my.ini
		    change entry: password       = root
			
	3.3) Stop and Start the Xampp Application services (Apache&Mysql)
	     now you can access localhost/phpmyadmin again

   - Copy your project under the folder C:\Users\$USERNAME\Desktop\Xampp\htdocs\phpformular
   - open the browser and hit http://localhost/phpformular/index.php
